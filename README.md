ExAws
=====
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CargoSense/ex_aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CargoSense/ex_aws)

A flexible easy to use set of AWS APIs.

- `ExAws.Cloudwatch`
- `ExAws.Dynamo`
- `ExAws.DynamoStreams`
- `ExAws.EC2`
- `ExAws.ElasticTranscoder`
- `ExAws.Firehose`
- `ExAws.Kinesis`
- `ExAws.KMS`
- `ExAws.Lambda`
- `ExAws.RDS`
- `ExAws.Route53`
- `ExAws.S3`
- `ExAws.SES`
- `ExAws.SNS`
- `ExAws.SQS`
- `ExAws.STS`

## 1.0.0 Changes

The `v0.5` branch holds the legacy approach.

ExAws 1.0.0 takes a more data driven approach to querying APIs. The various
functions that exist inside a service like `S3.list_objects` or
`Dynamo.create_table` all return a struct which holds the information necessary
to make that particular operation.

You then have 4 ways you can choose to execute that operation:

```elixir
# Simple
S3.list_buckets |> ExAws.request #=> {:ok, response}
# With per request configuration overrides
S3.list_buckets |> ExAws.request(config) #=> {:ok, response}

# Raise on error, return successful responses directly
S3.list_buckets |> ExAws.request! #=> response
S3.list_buckets |> ExAws.request!(config) #=> response
```

Certain operations also support Elixir streams:

```elixir
S3.list_objects("my-bucket") |> ExAws.stream! #=> #Function<13.52451638/2 in Stream.resource/3>
S3.list_objects("my-bucket") |> ExAws.stream!(config) #=> #Function<13.52451638/2 in Stream.resource/3>
```

The ability to return a stream is noticed in the function's documentation.

### Migration

TL;DR:
Do this now:
```
ExAws.S3.get_object("my-bucket", "path/to/object") |> ExAws.request
```
not
```
ExAws.S3.get_object("my-bucket", "path/to/object")
```

This change greatly simplifies the ExAws code paths, and removes entirely the
complex meta-programming pervasive to the original approach. However, it does
constitute a breaking change for anyone who had a client with custom logic.

#### DynamoDB Users

Lists are always encoded as dynamodb lists now. Previously if you had `[1,2,3]`
it would be encoded as an integer set. This had issues because if the list was
`[1,2,1]` you could get an error because the items are not unique.

## Highlighted Features
- Easy configuration.
- Minimal dependencies. Choose your favorite JSON codec and HTTP client.
- Elixir streams to automatically retrieve paginated resources.
- Elixir protocols allow easy customization of Dynamo encoding / decoding.
- `mix kinesis.tail your-stream-name` task for easily watching the contents of a kinesis stream.
- Simple. ExAws aims to provide a clear and consistent elixir wrapping around AWS APIs, not abstract them away entirely. For every action in a given AWS API there is a corresponding function within the appropriate module. Higher level abstractions like the aforementioned streams are in addition to and not instead of basic API calls.

## Getting started

Add ex_aws to your mix.exs, along with your json parser and http client of
choice. ExAws works out of the box with Poison and :hackney and sweet_xml. All
APIs require an http client, but only some require a json or xml codec. You only
need the codec for the API you intend to use. At this time only SweetXml is
supported for xml parsing.

- Dynamo: json
- Kinesis: json
- Kms: json
- Lambda: json
- SQS: xml
- S3: xml

If you wish to use instance roles to obtain AWS access keys you will need to add
a JSON codec whether the particular API requires one or not.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, "~> 1.0"},
    {:poison, "~> 2.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.6"}
  ]
end
```
Don't forget to add :hackney to your applications list if that's in fact the
http client you choose. `:ex_aws` must always be added to your applications
list.

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:ex_aws, :hackney, :poison]]
end
```

That's it!

ExAws has by default the equivalent including the following in your mix.exs

```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role],
```

This means it will try to resolve credentials in order
* Look for the AWS standard `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables
* Resolve credentials with IAM
  * If running inside ECS and a [task role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) has been assigned it will use it
  * Otherwise it will fall back to the [instance role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)

AWS CLI config files are supported, but require an additional dependency:

```elixir
{:configparser_ex, "~> 0.2.1"}
```

You can then add `{:awscli, "profile_name", timeout}` to the above config and it
will pull information from `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`
```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, {:awscli, "default", 30}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, {:awscli, "default", 30}, :instance_role],
```
## Retries

ExAws will retry failed AWS API requests using exponential backoff per the "Full
Jitter" formula described in
https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html

The algorithm uses three values, which are configurable:

```elixir
# default values shown below

config :ex_aws, :retries,
  max_attempts: 10,
  base_backoff_in_ms: 10,
  max_backoff_in_ms: 10_000
```

* `max_attempts` is the maximum number of possible attempts with backoffs in between each one
* `base_backoff_in_ms` corresponds to the `base` value described in the blog post
* `max_backoff_in_ms` corresponds to the `cap` value described in the blog post
